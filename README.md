# Todo-app-with-api
- [DEMO LINK](https://anmonnn.github.io/todo-app-with-api/)

This is a React application for managing a Todo list. Users can add, edit, delete, and filter their todos. The application also handles errors gracefully and displays appropriate notifications. The todos are fetched from and saved to a backend API.

Technologies Used:
- React: For building the user interface and managing state.
- TypeScript: For type-checking and improving code quality.
- SCSS: For styling the application with variables and mixins to support adaptive design for both PCs and mobile devices.
- Classnames: For conditionally applying CSS classes.
- ESLint: For linting and ensuring code quality.
- React Hooks: For managing component state and side effects (useState, useEffect, useRef).
- API Client: Custom-built to handle HTTP requests.
